This is the repo for GigaGrims teams work on Wearable's, Gemini and Mental Health (Bipolar Tracking/Detection)

This repository contains the work of the GigaGrims team, focused on leveraging wearable devices, Gemini AI, and mental health analysis with a primary focus on Bipolar Disorder Tracking and Detection. The project aims to provide innovative solutions by combining objective data (from wearables) and subjective data (from self-reports, mood logs, and voice inputs) to detect, track, and intervene in mental health episodes.

Project Overview
Problem Statement:
Current wearable devices provide valuable physical metrics, but they lack advanced feedback mechanisms for mental health. Our project integrates real-time wearable data (such as HRV, sleep patterns, and activity) with AI-driven insights, allowing for better detection of bipolar disorder episodes and providing personalized interventions.

Proposed Solution:
Multimodal Data Integration:

Wearable Data: Sleep patterns, HRV, activity levels, heart rate, and electrodermal activity (EDA).
Self-Reported Data: Mood logs, symptom checklists, and daily journaling.
Voice Input: Daily sentiment analysis based on spoken input, providing additional insights.
AI for Mental Health:

Utilizes Google Gemini AI for mental health diagnostics, leveraging the AI model for personalized feedback and intervention suggestions.
Voice Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment and mood analysis through the userâ€™s spoken words, analyzed with advanced NLP techniques.
Bipolar Disorder Detection:

Detects manic, depressive, and euthymic phases based on combined data inputs.
Identifies prodromal (early signs) of bipolar episodes to aid in preventive interventions.
Technologies Used
Google Gemini AI: Used for generating insights and analyzing multimodal mental health data.
Google Cloud Speech-to-Text: For transcribing voice data into text for analysis.
Google Dialogflow: Used to create voice-based conversational agents.
Python: Main programming language for data analysis, model integration, and API interaction.
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib: Data handling and visualization tools.
Google Cloud APIs: Integration with Google Health Connect (formerly Google Fit) for wearable data.
